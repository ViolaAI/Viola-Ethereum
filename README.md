# Voila-Ethereum

Smart contracts for Voila crowdsale

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following softwares installed

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8.9.3
- [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) version 4.0.3
- [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) version 6.0.3

## Getting Started
Clone this repository. Change directory to this project folder
```
cd Viola-Ethereum
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
## Test
In the project folder, run the following command
```
./scripts/test.sh
```
Remember to make shell script executable by running `chmod u+x ./scripts/test.sh`

## Deployment to Rinkeby
Compile contracts
```
truffle compile
```
Migrate to Rinkeby
```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

## Compiling with Remix
To compile in Remix, we first need to flatten the contract codes into one file.
We can use the following program to help us with that.

```
clone git@github.com:poanetwork/oracles-combine-solidity.git
cd /oracles-combine-solidity
npm install
npm start <path to Viola project>/contracts/ViolaCrowdsale.sol
```
The output file `ViolaCrowdsale_flat.sol` can be found in `out` folder

## Built With

- [Zeppelin-Solidity](https://openzeppelin.org/) version 1.4.0

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/2359media/viola-ethereum/tags).
